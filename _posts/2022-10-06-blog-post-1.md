Here I will write down some of the notes regarding the some classes and books that I am currently taking/reading on computer science basics.

# definitions

- **bit:** a single unit of storage and can only store a [boolean entity](#boolean entity) type of info ("0" or "1" / "true" or "false"). It can be physically be released as a NAND gate formed by two transistors. A particular arrangement of bits is called a *state* and an *image* is the literal physical configuration of these bits. For example in the upper-case letter *A* is a *state*, whereas the hexadecimal representation of *A* in *ASCII* configuration is 01000001 and this is the *image*. 

- **boolean entity:** a boolean expression is a logical expression between boolean entities such as on-off computer circuit elements, for example a NAND gate.

- **byte:** collection of 8 bits. It can store the basic character in a computer like '2' or 'T' etc.

-**main memory:** is the collection of bytes in a physical computer.
