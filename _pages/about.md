I am trained as an experimental physicist. In my latest work I had the role of Research Data Engineer in Paul-Drude-Institut Berlin. Before that, I was working as a scientific engineer in the Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam. I am interested in experimental & computational condensed matter physics and related instrumentation. Lately, I also developed some skills around self-hosting, Linux administration and container technology.

I graduated with a M.Sc. in Physics from Freie Universit√§t Berlin with the thesis title "Spin- and Momentum-Resolved Electron Dynamics of Topological Surface States" where I investigated the topological surface state of $Sb_2Te_3$ with Angle-Resolved Time of Flight(ARTOF) experiments. During that time, also I worked on system design for spin resolution momentum microscopy by designing a UHV chamber and a crystal holder of the spin filter.

You can find some related work that I have done in the research menu. For example, design work of UHV systems, data analysis package for ARPES systems, and several other projects are listed. 

In the blog, I try to write about technical topics that I am interested in; Linux systems, 3d printing, custom electronics, and some practical physics calculations.

Also, you can check my drawing portfolio, mostly storyboards, if you are interested.
